# CLI Todo – Command Line Task Manager

A simple command-line to-do list application built with **Python** as a learning project.

This repository is being developed step-by-step over 12 days to practice core Python fundamentals.

## Current Status (Day 1)

- Project initialization
- Welcome message with basic formatting
- Usage of basic variable types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- First Git commit with project structure

### Features

(Planned – being implemented day by day)

- [ ] Add new tasks with title & optional description
- [ ] List all tasks with status & basic info
- [ ] Mark tasks as completed
- [ ] Delete tasks
- [ ] Set priority level for tasks
- [ ] Persistent storage (save/load tasks using JSON file)
- [ ] Basic input validation & error messages
- [ ] Clean command-line interface with numbered menu
- [ ] Help / usage instructions inside the program

### Key Notes

- Pure Python – only using the **standard library** (no external packages)
- Project-based learning: each day adds one or more fundamental Python concept
- Focus on **readability**, **simple structure** and **good naming**
- Following official Python style guide (**PEP 8**) as much as possible
- Designed to be beginner-friendly but gradually introduces real-world patterns
- Suitable as a first portfolio project for junior Python developers
- 100% console-based (CLI) – no GUI
